        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.

        <p>I recently tried out this  simple recipe for peanut butter cookies, and I must say, they turned out wonderful! As someone who usually shies away from baking due to complicated recipes, I was  surprised by how easy and straightforward this was. The cookies had the perfect balance of sweetness and peanut butter flavor, with a chewy texture. I added in some chocolate chips to give an extra layer of indulgence. The aroma that filled my kitchen while they were baking was heavenly, and they were a hit with everyone who tried them. It's definitely a recipe I'll be returning to whenever I need a quick and satisfying treat!

        <p>I recently tried my hand at making these Outrageous Cookie Bars, and let me tell you, they were an absolute hit! The process was surprisingly simple, and the result was a delightful blend of flavors and textures that had everyone asking for seconds. The bars had a rich, buttery base, with a gooey layer of chocolate and a perfect crunch from the nuts. The sweetness of the condensed milk brought everything together in a decadent, mouth-watering treat. What I loved most was the versatility. You can easily swap out the nuts or chips for your favorites. Baking these bars filled my kitchen with an irresistible aroma that made the wait almost unbearable, but it was so worth it. The bars came out golden and tempting, with a chewy yet crisp texture that was pure bliss in every bite. Perfect for any gathering, these Outrageous Cookie Bars are not just a dessert, they're a conversation starter!

        <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1 (14 oz) can sweetened condensed milk</li>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Preheat Oven:</b> Start by preheating your oven to 350째F (175째C). Line a 9x13 inch baking pan with parchment paper or lightly grease it.</li>
        <li><b>Prepare the Base:</b> In a bowl, combine melted butter with graham cracker crumbs until well mixed. Press this mixture evenly into the bottom of the prepared baking pan to form the crust.</li>
        <li><b>Layer the Ingredients:</b> Pour the sweetened condensed milk evenly over the crumb layer. Next, layer the chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and chopped nuts over the condensed milk. If you're using coconut, sprinkle it on top.</li>

        <li><b>Cool and Slice:</b> Remove the pan from the oven and allow the bars to cool completely in the pan. Once cooled, lift out the bars using the parchment paper and slice them into desired sizes.</li>
